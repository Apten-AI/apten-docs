## Overview

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password. This tutorial will guide you through setting up two-step verification using an authenticator app.

## Step 1: Sign In to Your Account

Sign in to your account using username and password like normal. Make sure you're signed in with the account you want to secure with MFA.

## Step 2: Navigate to Manage Account Page

1. Click on your profile icon in the bottom left corner
2. Select **Manage Account** from the menu
3. You'll be redirected to your account management dashboard

3. Follow the prompts to add authenticator app MFA

### Save Recovery Codes

1. **Download Recovery Codes**: After successful setup, you'll be presented with backup recovery codes
2. **Store Safely**: Save these codes in a secure location (password manager, secure note, etc.)
3. **Important**: These codes can be used to access your account if you lose access to your authenticator app

<Note>
  Recovery codes are crucial for account recovery. Each code can only be used
  once, so store them securely and don't share them with anyone.
</Note>

## Managing Your MFA Settings

### Disabling MFA (Not Recommended)

1. Go to **Security Settings**
2. Find the **Two-Step Verification** section
3. Click **Remove**
4. Confirm your decision (you may need to enter a current MFA code)

<Note>
  Disabling MFA reduces your account security. Only disable if absolutely
  necessary, and consider re-enabling it as soon as possible.
</Note>

## How MFA Works Once Setup

1. **Sign In**: Enter your username and password as usual
2. **Second Factor**: Provide a time-based code from your authenticator app
3. **Access Granted**: Successfully access your account with verified identity
