## Lead Tagged

This event occurs when a new lead is tagged by Apten. The webhook payload contains
information about the lead that was tagged, including the lead's phone number and the associated tag. The tag name will match up to the name you define in the UI.

### Payload

The following payload is sent when a lead is tagged:

```json
{
  "event": "leadTagged"
  {
    "phone": string,
    "tag": string
  },
  "timestamp": string (ISO 8601 format)
}
```

### Out-of-the-box Tags

By default, Apten sends events for a few tags out-of-the-box:
- hasReplied
- isHot
- isQualified
