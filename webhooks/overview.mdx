## Why use webhooks

The Apten API is designed to be used in real-time applications. Webhooks are a way to receive
real-time notifications from the Attent API when certain events occur. For example, you may want
to know when Apten tags a new lead, or when a new notification is created. Webhooks are a way for
the Attent API to send these real-time events to your application.

## Configuring webhooks

To configure webhooks, you must provide a URL where the Attent API can send events.
You can configure webhooks in the [Developer Portal](https://platform.attent.app/developer). Once
you have configured a webhook, the Attent API will send an HTTP request to the URL you provided
with JSON data whenever the event occurs.

You can also provide a secret key when configuring a webhook. The secret key is used to sign the
webhook request, so you can verify that the request is coming from the Attent API. You can learn more
about verifying webhooks in the [Verifying Webhooks](/webhooks/verification) section.

The two types of events that can trigger a webhook are:

- [**Lead Tagged**](/webhooks/lead-tagged): This event occurs when a new lead is tagged by Apten.
- [**Notification Created**](/webhooks/notification-created): This event occurs when a new notification is created by Apten.
