## Why use webhooks

The Apten API is designed to be used in real-time applications. Webhooks are a way to receive
real-time notifications from the Apten API when certain events occur. For example, you may want
to know when Apten tags a new lead, when a message is received from a lead, or when a lead opts out. Webhooks are a way for
the Apten API to send these real-time events to your application.

## Configuring webhooks

To configure webhooks, you must provide a URL where the Apten API can send events.
You can configure webhooks in the [Developer Portal](https://platform.attent.app/developer). Once
you have configured a webhook, the Apten API will send an HTTP request to the URL you provided
with JSON data whenever the event occurs.

You can also provide a secret key when configuring a webhook. The secret key is used to sign the
webhook request, so you can verify that the request is coming from the Apten API. You can learn more
about verifying webhooks in the [Verifying Webhooks](/webhooks/verification) section.

## Available Webhook Events

The following events can trigger a webhook:

- [**Lead Tagged**](/webhooks/lead-tagged): This event occurs when a lead is tagged by Apten.
- [**Notification Created**](/webhooks/notification-created): This event occurs when a new notification is created by Apten.
- [**Message Received**](/webhooks/message-received): This event occurs when a message is received from a lead.
- [**Message Sent**](/webhooks/message-sent): This event occurs when a message is sent to a lead.
- [**Opt Out**](/webhooks/opt-out): This event occurs when a lead opts out of messaging.

## Webhook Event Schema Body

Webhook endpoints will be called with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "event": "eventName", // Event name
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z", // Datetime string in ISO 8601 format
  "data": {} // Event-specific details
}
```
