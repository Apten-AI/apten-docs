## Webhook signature

To ensure that the webhook request is coming from the Apten API, you can verify the request
by checking the `X-Signature-SHA256` header. The `X-Signature-SHA256` header contains a HMAC SHA256
signature of the request body using your webhook secret. You can verify the signature by
recomputing the HMAC signature using the request body and your webhook secret, and comparing
it to the value in the `X-Signature-SHA256` header.

<Note>
  * Apten uses an HMAC hex digest to compute the hash.
  
  * Make sure that you always handle the payload as UTF-8. Webhook payloads can contain
  unicode characters.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Avoid using a plain `==` operator. A safer alternative includes
  `crypto.timingSafeEqual` or `compare_digest`, which helps protect you from
  certain timing attacks against regular equality operators.
</Warning>

Here are some examples of how you can verify a webhook request:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import crypto from 'crypto';

const verifyWebhook = (req) => {
  const secret = 'your-webhook-secret';
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const signature = req.headers['X-Signature-SHA256'];

  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload, 'utf8')
    .digest('hex');

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(hash), Buffer.from(signature));
};
```

```python Python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(request):
    secret = 'your-web-secret'
    payload = request.get_data()
    signature = request.headers.get('X-Signature-SHA256')

    hash = hmac.new(secret.encode('utf-8'), payload, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

    return hmac.compare_digest(hash, signature)
```
