## Base URL

Our API is built around a RESTful architecture. All requests are made to the base URL:

```
https://api.attent.app/v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API key in the header.
You may obtain an API key from the [Developer Portal](https://platform.attent.app/developer).
The API key is passed in the `x-api-key` header:

```json
{
  "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
}
```

## Response Codes

HTTP response codes are used to indicate the success or failure of an API request. The following response codes are used:

{/* TODO: add 401 Unauthorized? */}

| Code  | Description                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `200` | Successful Request                                                 |
| `400` | Bad Request - check that input parameters are correctly formatted. |
| `403` | Forbidden - the supplied API key is missing or invalid.            |
| `404` | Not Found - the requested resource does not exist.                 |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - you have exceeded a quota or the rate limit.   |
| `500` | Server Error - this indicates an error within Apten servers.       |
