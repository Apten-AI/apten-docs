title: Rescribe a lead to text messages
openapi: post /leads/{leadId}/resubscribe
---

### Notes

This API only works if the lead has unsubscribed via Apten''s smart-unsubscribe feature, or via user-defined custom unsubscribe keywords. Leads who opt-out via a default keyword (e.g. "STOP", "UNSUBSCRIBE", "CANCEL", "END", "QUIT", and "STOP ALL") are ineligible for resubscription.

This API also turns Apten on for the lead.
