## Overview

Connect your Apten account with Hubspot to sync information about leads and conversations in Apten with any Hubspot object. Currently, we support syncing:

- **Tags**: sync tags into a custom field in Hubspot.
- **Summaries**: sync lead conversation summaries into a custom field in Hubspot.
- **Variables**: map variables to custom fields in Hubspot, which will sync in real-time.

Hubspot syncing works with AI conversations over SMS, voice, and email.

## Step 1: Connect Apten to Hubspot

1. In Apten, go to **Integrations**.
2. Click **Connect** on the Hubspot card.
3. You will be redirected to Hubspot. If you are not already logged in, you will be prompted to do so.
4. Review the permissions requested by Apten and click **Connect app**. This will install the Apten app in your Hubspot account.
5. You will be redirected back to Apten.

## Step 2: Configure Syncing

If you'd like to sync Tags or Summaries, click the **Set up** button next to the relevant section. This will create a custom property on the object in Hubspot (`Apten Tags`, `Apten Summary`) and enable syncing.

## Step 3: Map Variables (Optional)

When setting up variables in customer profiles in **Build & Test**, you can map them to Hubspot fields.

These fields will automatically sync to Hubspot in real-time when Apten talks to a lead.

## Step 4: Import Leads with Hubspot IDs

When importing leads into Apten, you must set the following fields:

- `integrationSource`: Set this to `'hubspot'` to indicate the lead is from Hubspot.
- `hubspotId`: Set this to the Hubspot object ID of the lead (e.g. the Contact's `vid`).

Example payload:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "customerProfile": "Test Profile",
  "integrationSource": "hubspot", // Required for Sync
  "hubspotId": "12345" // Required for Sync
}
```
