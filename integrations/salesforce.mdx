## Overview

Connect your Apten account with Salesforce to sync information about leads and SMS conversations in Apten with any Salesforce object. Currently, we support syncing:

- **Tags**: sync tags into a custom field in Salesforce.
- **Summaries**: sync lead conversation summaries into a custom field in Salesforce.
- **Variables**: map variables to custom fields in Salesforce, which will sync in real-time.

Salesforce syncing works with AI conversations over SMS, voice, and email.

## Step 1: Create an Integration User in Salesforce

1. Log in to Salesforce as an administrator
2. Navigate to Setup > Users > New User
3. Fill in the required fields:

   - First Name: Apten
   - Last Name: Integration
   - Email: [email for the integration user]
   - Username: [unique username for integration]
   - Role: [assign an appropriate role]
   - User License: Salesforce Integration
   - Profile: Salesforce API Only System Integrations

4. Click "Save" to create the Integration User

## Step 2: Create a Permission Set in Salesforce

1. Navigate to Setup > Permission Sets > New
2. Create a new Permission Set:

   - Label: Apten Integration Permissions
   - API Name: Apten_Integration_Permissions

3. Click "Save" to create the Permission Set

4. Configure the Permission Set:
   - Under "System Permissions", enable:
     - API Enabled
     - Modify All Data
     - Customize Application (so that Apten can set-up custom fields)
   - Under "Object Settings", enable:
     - Read, Create, Edit permissions the object that you want to sync with Apten (e.g., Lead, Contact, etc.), along with any fields on that object that you want to sync.
5. Assign the Permission Set to the Integration User:
   - Go to Setup > Permission Sets
   - Click on the "Apten Integration Permissions" Permission Set
   - Click "Manage Assignments"
   - Click "Add Assignments"
   - Select the Apten Integration User
   - Click "Assign"

## Step 3: Connect Apten to Salesforce

1. In Apten, go to **Integrations**
2. Click **Connect** on the Salesforce card
3. Authorize with the email and password for the Salesforce Integration User
4. Click **Connect**
5. Select the object that you want to sync with Apten (e.g., Lead, Contact, etc.), and click **Save** (you won't be able to change this later).
6. If you'd like to sync Tags or Summaries, click the **Set up** button next to the relevant section.
   - This will create a custom field on the object in Salesforce (Apten_Tags\_\_c, Apten_Summary\_\_c) and enable syncing.
   - **Important: You MUST remember to update your permission set in Salesforce to include the new custom field, or syncing will fail.**

## Step 4: Map Variables (Optional)

When setting up variables in customer profiles in **Build & Test**, you can map them to Salesforce fields.

These fields will automatically sync to Salesforce in real-time when Apten talks to a lead.

## Step 5: Import Leads with Salesforce IDs

When importing leads into Apten, you must set the following fields:

- `integrationSource`: Set this to `'salesforce'` to indicate the lead is from Salesforce
- `salesforceId`: Set this to the Salesforce object ID of the lead (e.g. '00Q1a000004XYZ')

Example payload:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phone": "1234567890",
  "customerProfile": "Test Profile",
  "integrationSource": "salesforce", // Required for Sync
  "salesforceId": "00Q1a000004XYZ" // Required for Sync
}
```
